# Health Tech IoT Database Benchmarking Project

## Performance and Security Benchmarking of Time-Series Databases with InfluxDB for Health Tech IoT

### Project Overview
This project benchmarks three database systems (PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB, InfluxDB, MongoDB) for managing Health IoT data with a focus on both performance and security.

### Key Features
- **Health IoT Dataset**: Synthetic patient vital signs and medical device telemetry
- **Security Benchmarking**: HIPAA-compliant security implementations
- **Performance Metrics**: Ingestion rate, query latency, storage efficiency, indexing performance
- **Comparative Analysis**: Cross-database performance comparison

### Database Systems Tested
1. **PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB**: With Row-Level Security (RLS)
2. **InfluxDB**: With token-based security
3. **MongoDB**: With role-based access control
